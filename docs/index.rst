================================

Introduction
------------

Rabs is a general purpose build system, designed for fast and consistent incremental rebuilds.

Rabs is designed to build (or rebuild) a set of targets as necessary, by considering dependencies and changes to the contents / values of those dependencies.
For a general overview of targets in Rabs, see here: :doc:`targets/targets`. 

Rabs provides several types of targets: 

* :doc:`targets/files`
* :doc:`targets/symbols`
* :doc:`targets/meta`
* :doc:`targets/expressions`
* :doc:`targets/scans`


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
